           <p> My first project was my Portfolio. This was during my time in Code School, where I was truly first introduced into the vast world of programming. The picture above is a screenshot of the Design page of my project. Here is a look on my formatting and HTML use. This was definitely a challenge, getting things to be styled correctly and making use of imbeded works and links, but this was fun all the same.

            <p>My first coding experience was in a Tech901 game design program. There we were introduced to Unity and the front end of game designing. The three games we made were a Rolling Ball, a Platformer, and my favorite and most complete, a FPS (First Person Shooter). There was little coding aspect due to time and difficulty, but we did discus the different properties of HTMl and actions one can use to get things to move, have weight and restart.
