        <p id="bigg"><strong>Hello!</strong> <br></p>
        My name is Christian Williams, and I am a student within the Code School program 2019 cohort.<br>

        <p> I am always eager for new experiences and people in this area of design and coding brings. I am a creative and design-forward person who loves to bring in many different insights and styles in my work. While working I am highly motivated to do my very best to the fullest of my abilities. I never believed that there is a limit to the possibilities and knowledge that are to come my way, whether it was developing apps, websites or programs, When presented with a challenge, I always try to complete or solve it with grace, maturity, and a lot of internalized frustration. </p>

        <p> <br> Although my involvement with coding and software are my main focus, I have experience in other fields such as the Arts and Music. I have worked in many places such as theatres, non-profits, music business and development that fuel my passion for development in myself, work, and life ethics. Those great people and experience shaped mew to be the excited and eager person I am today. And in the event you may find me to be perfect for your business or project, I can promise to bring a positive can-do attitude and a new outlook to your ideas. </p>

        <p> <br>I don't have a personal motto or saying to live by, but if i was to have one it would be "Always keep a full bookshelf." and "Be who you needed when you were younger." A quote that always stuck with me in every situation I've been in. I want to be the best me, so not only I can be successful and happy in the future, but to look back onto the past and be grateful I have changed. </p>

        <p><br>This AWESOME portfolio was a website designed and created from SCRATCH using HTML and CSS. </p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio, have a great day!<p/>
    </p>
